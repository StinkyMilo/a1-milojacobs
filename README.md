This project shows a quick information page about me, including CS classes taken, work experience, and web development experience. The JavaScript shows my ability to code in JS and bounces the table of work experience
back and forth across the screen. It should adjust to different screen sizes, but it could get stuck if you make it smaller while it's partially off-screen.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the p, body, headings, li, th, header, and a.
- **Experimented with semantic HTML tags**: I used a table, header (with a speical background color), section (with no special CSS rules, but it separates the introduction from the rest of the content), 
a footer (with a special background and paragraph color), a nav (with no CSS rules but that shows a section of links), and a (for links).
- **JavaScript Animation**: I made my work experience table bounce around the screen using JavaScript.


## Design Achievements
- **Created a color palette using color.adobe.com**: The screenshot is included.
- **Used the Courier Prime Font from Google Fonts**: I used Courier Prime as the font for all text on the page.
